### Aims of this project
This project creates an outline of how one may implement multithreading and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to handle incoming requests, connect them to a database, and send a reply.

### Installation
To run this, you will need a PostgreSQL JDBC driver as your project library, see [here](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html) to download one.
This project was built using the PostgreSQL JDBC 4.2 Driver, 42.2.20.

### Use
This project provides a general outline. 
I have inserted TODO tags where I think you might want to insert your own code, to implement your required functionality.
