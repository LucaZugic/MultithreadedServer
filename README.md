### Aims of this project
This project creates an outline of how one may implement multithreading and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to handle incoming requests, connect them to a database, and send a reply.

To run this, you will need a PostgreSQL JDBC driver as your project library, see [here](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html) to download one.
This project was built using the PostgreSQL JDBC 4.2 Driver, 42.2.20.
